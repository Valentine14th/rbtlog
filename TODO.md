# TODO

- [x] use repro-apk instead of aapt
- [ ] JSON schema + validation for recipes
- [ ] JSON schema + validation for logs
- [ ] provisioning: `build_env()` and `provision.sh` are incomplete

# Nice to have

- [ ] retry downloads
- [ ] configure timeouts
- [ ] configure paths
- [ ] other build backends than docker

# Maybe

- [ ] diff on signature copying failure?
- [ ] stream build log to stderr?
- [ ] log commit?
- [ ] log hashes of .sh & .py?
- [ ] use apksigner instead of shasum equality?
